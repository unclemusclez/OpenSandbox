# SDKs AGENTS

You are working on OpenSandbox SDKs. Keep generated and handwritten code separate, and keep behavior aligned across languages when the same capability exists in multiple SDKs.

## Scope

- `sandbox/**`
- `code-interpreter/**`
- `mcp/**`

If the task is driven by spec changes, also read `../specs/AGENTS.md`.

## Key Areas

- `sandbox/python`, `sandbox/javascript`, `sandbox/kotlin`, `sandbox/csharp`
- `code-interpreter/python`, `code-interpreter/javascript`, `code-interpreter/kotlin`, `code-interpreter/csharp`
- `mcp/`
- Workspace config in `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, and shared build files

## Generated Code

Do not manually edit generated code as the only fix.

Generator-owned paths include:

- `sandbox/python/src/opensandbox/api/**`
- `sandbox/javascript/src/api/*.ts`
- `sandbox/kotlin/sandbox-api/build/generated/**`

Handwritten logic belongs in adapters, services, facades, converters, and stable SDK models.

## Commands

Workspace JS install:

```bash
cd sdks
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

JavaScript SDK checks:

```bash
cd sdks
pnpm run lint:js
pnpm run typecheck:js
pnpm run build:js
pnpm run test:js
```

Python sandbox SDK:

```bash
cd sdks/sandbox/python
uv sync
uv run python scripts/generate_api.py
uv run ruff check
uv run pyright
uv run pytest tests/ -v
uv build
```

JavaScript sandbox SDK:

```bash
cd sdks/sandbox/javascript
pnpm run gen:api
pnpm run lint
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run build
pnpm run test
```

Kotlin sandbox SDK:

```bash
cd sdks/sandbox/kotlin
./gradlew :sandbox-api:generateLifecycleApi :sandbox-api:generateExecdApi :sandbox-api:generateEgressApi
./gradlew spotlessApply :sandbox:test
```

## Guardrails

Always:

- For spec-driven changes, regenerate affected SDK code, update handwritten layers, then run affected language checks.
- Add a regression test for every bug fix.
- Prefer tests for request mapping, response conversion, error mapping, streaming behavior, and resource cleanup.
- Keep package-local validation fast before widening to multi-language verification.
- Match public behavior across languages unless a documented platform constraint prevents it.
- Keep wire-format units and public SDK units separate. Public SDK interfaces should expose time durations as language-native duration types where available (`timedelta`, `Duration`) or otherwise as explicitly second-based fields such as `timeoutSeconds`.

Ask first:

- Public breaking changes
- Large cross-language refactors
- Intentional behavior drift between languages

Never:

- Patch generated output as the only fix.
- Change SDK public behavior without tests.
- Mix unrelated non-SDK work into an SDK change.

## Good Patterns

- Generated clients for normal request/response APIs
- Handwritten transport only for streaming or protocol-specific paths such as SSE
